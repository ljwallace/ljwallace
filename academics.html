	<h1>Managing Academics</h>

	<p> While an individual is more prone to distractions while in college, the number one priority should always be academics. Use these tips to help you manage academics and get the most out of your college experience!</p>

	<ul>
		<li> Attend class: although obvious, it is important for you to attend class so that you can become familiar with professors, understand the information, and retain the content.</li>
		<li> Turn in all assignments: you want to make sure that you are completing work on time and with clear effort. You don't want to turn in assignments late because all are essential to making sure you get that good grade.</li>
		<li> STUDY: make sure you set aside time to study. This is important because midterms, exams, and quizzes usually account for the bulk of one's grade. Find what study habits work best for you and have fun while doing them!</li>
