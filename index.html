	<p> College Guide 101 is an informational tool for [prospective] college students seeking resources about how to navigate college. The guide is a culmination of experiences from current and former college students who describe what strategies made college more enjoyable. Although the experiences come from students who attend (have attended) the <a href="https://wisc.edu">University of Wisconsin-Madison</a>, all of the information provided can be applied to any college or University. Our site even offers a feature where students and alumni can connect with students from different colleges in the U.S. and it's territories. The founders of the site thought it would be beneficial to offer extensive insight into what life in college looks like. Because college is an investment, no-one should embark on the journey without guidance or relevant advice.</p>
