	<h1>Essential Advice</h>

	<p> For many of you, you will be college students for the first time and do not know what to expect in regards to a social life, managing funds, and maintaining good health. The advice below comes from what students wish they would have known before coming to college.</p>

	<ul>
		<li> Choose friends wisely: not everyone in college has the best intentions or are necessarily trust worthy. You should aim to know the names of faces on campus, but it's most important that you distinguish the nature of specific friendships. For example, find 1-3 friends who you feel comfortable confiding in, a couple friends who you go out with, and a group who you study with.</li>
		<li> Practice safe sex: for a lot of students, this will be your first opportunity to embark on adulthood and you may be introduced to new things including sex. Before engaging in sex, have conversations about protection, contraceptives, sex history, etc. and always remember to practice consent.</li>
		<li> Manage your money: you might have the urge to splurge, but make sure that you budget your money so that you don't experience financial stress on top of academic, mental, and emotional stress. Learn how to save money for priorities and rainy days, but also remember to treat yourself to things you enjoy.</li>
